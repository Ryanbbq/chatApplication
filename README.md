# Chat Application that uses socket.io

## https://chat-applicationhw5.herokuapp.com/

## Names of your team members, including how you distributed the work between your team members.  Write about your strategy for handling the “interfaces” between each other’s code. 
</break> The names of our team members are Ryan Lebon, Brian Little, Kristine Yvonne Laranjo, and Monique La Croix.

Distribution: Ryan and Brian worked on getting the sockets to work, and getting the main functions of the chat app to work. Ryan also created the repository for it and deployed it on Heroku. Kristine worked on CSS and other functions of the app. Monique worked on the Read Me file and helped with CSS as well. Each person tried in their own way to get the chat app to work.

</break> We handled the interfaces between each other by collaborting on GitHub, and emailing each other. We met up in person to discuss certain parts of this chat application.

## What are known problems, if any, with your project?
</break> A problem we encountered at first was confusion about whether it was an individual homework or group. Other than that, we struggled for a little on getting the user count, but we did get it.

## How would you improve it if you had more time?
</break> If we had more time we would make the chat just like a pop up version, which we might try for our actual final project.
